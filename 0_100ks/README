Steps to follow:
1. Edit the configuration.yaml file with the lalsky maps and multiorder GW maps and other setting to use in analysis
2. Run sky_localization_credible.ipynb to get the list of RA, DEC to get the pointings within 90% credible patch. THis will be saved in ra_dec_list.txt
3. Now run download_data.py
	|| python download_data.py
4. Run the shell script on each folder corresponsing to each pointing. You can also set the time periods you wish to analyse by changing tstart and tend in ./Impfiles/valid_time_bnNone.txt. By default the code analyzed 0-10ks in 20ks bins
	|| . ./run_RunFermi_script.sh
